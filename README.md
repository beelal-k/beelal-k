**`Web Developer`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer building my version of the world one line at a time. All of my projects are built from the ground up, starting from the planning phase all the way to deployment. I have a knack for building minimal and simplistic designs. You can check out what I've built here, on github, or through my website: **https://beelal-k.github.io/**

#  Sup, I'm Bilal

I'm an indie software engineer. All of my projects are built from the ground up, starting from the planning phase all the way to deployment. I have a knack for building minimal and simplistic designs. You can check out what I've built, on my website: **https://beelal-k.github.io/** (Although it has projects that are 3 years old)
